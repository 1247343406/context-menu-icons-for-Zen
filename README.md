# context-menu-icons-for-Zen
Bring the icon of the context menu back to Zen browser
## Important reminder: This mod is only for users who want to bring back the context menu icons but do not want to install Nebula. I have already integrated this mod into Nebula. Therefore, if you have already installed and are using Nebula, you do not need to install this mod. ##
## Some preview images of display effects, å’Œ all the menus have been correctly mapped with icons:

By the way, I couldn't find the original icon of Zen, so I used  [FluentUI](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons) instead.
In order to ensure a consistent icon style, the icons of the menu have also been replaced accordingly:
